# discord-recorder

Records the user's audio on Discord

## Environment Variables

- DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN: bot's token
- DISCORD_CLIENT_ID: bot's client id

dont forget to create the `recordings` folder

## Why?

I just wanted to learn how to use TypeScript and decided to make the bot an audio recorder. [Example code I used](https://github.com/discordjs/voice/tree/main/examples/recorder)<br>
Used inspiration from [this repository](https://github.com/tr1ckydev/s2am) to implement TypeScript
